# SysadminNotes
my first documented steps in learning SysAdministration
## some basic Bash scripts

there are two very basic scripts, but it is something, isn't it?

-[Hello,Name](variables.sh)
-[AskCredentials](morevariables.sh)

two more scripts that check a name of a user and print different responces

- [UserInput](user_input.sh)
- [CheckUsername](check_name.sh)
